This **boiler room** was built in 1911, to a design by architect Oscar Van de Voorde. The building keeps the site warm to this day, literally and figuratively. Part of the building still functions as a boiler room, the rest is filled daily with opera singing by the International Opera Academy. Stop for a moment and who knows, you might even catch a dash of opera...
