Can you also spot the many apple and pear trees on the site? These trees are relics of an orchard that is more than 3 centuries old. The Bijloke abbey and hospital were already reaping the benefits of their own cultivation in the early 18th century. According to historical sources, grafts from these trees were sold and exported elsewhere in Europe. The fruit trees you see here are therefore important living heritage.
