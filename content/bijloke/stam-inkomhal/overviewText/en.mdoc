The **STAM** &nbsp;is the Ghent city museum that brings the history of Ghent and makes you (even) more enthusiastic about this contemporary city with an ancient history.&nbsp;

The STAM (Ghent City Museum) is housed in the former Bijloke Abbey, which dates from the 14th and 17th centuries – well. In order to be able to welcome you as a museum visitor, a new building was added, designed by city architect Koen Van Nieuwenhuyse.&nbsp;
