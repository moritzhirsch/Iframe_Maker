The restored **Clinical and Outpatient Institute** was designed at the end of the 19th century by architect Louis Cloquet and includes 2 **anatomical theatres**. For decades, medical students from Ghent University took classes in these characteristic, semicircular auditoriums.

One of the rooms is now set up as a permanent exhibition hall of KIOSK. The other hall now serves – under the name Cirque – as a training place for students of KASK & Conservatory.
