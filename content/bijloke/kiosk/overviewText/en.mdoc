**KIOSK** offers space for contemporary art with a quirky program. The exhibition space is housed in the former Clinical and Outpatient Institute, which was built in 1905 by architect Louis Cloquet, a prominent Belgian representative of the neo-Gothic architectural style. The exhibition halls used to be didactic anatomical auditoriums.
